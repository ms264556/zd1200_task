	  c2lib is a C library with capabilities of vector, hash, string, etc. We don't want to use STL yet we'd like some of the functionalities.
	  c2lib uses the concept of 'pool' where you don't worry about memory management when you write codes and can simply delete the pool to free all memory that's dynamically allocated
