        LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol) (also known as 802.1ab) is
        an industry standard protocol designed to supplant proprietary
        Link-Layer protocols such as Extreme's EDP (Extreme Discovery Protocol)
        and CDP (Cisco Discovery Protocol). The goal of LLDP is to provide
        an inter-vendor compatible mechanism to deliver Link-Layer 
        notifications to adjacent network devices.
