      The debug memory allocation or dmalloc library has been designed as a drop in 
      replacement for the system's malloc, realloc, calloc, free and other memory management 
      routines while providing powerful debugging facilities configurable at runtime. These 
      facilities include such things as memory-leak tracking, fence-post write detection, 
      file/line number reporting, and general logging of statistics.
