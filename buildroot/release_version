# if changing release number
# Also need to check/update the following ZD files ...

# controller/ac/etc/migrate/helper.sh
#   version migration  information, if any
#   may need to add previous version

# controller/ac/REQUIRE_VERSIONS
#   required version to upgrade this from

# controller/ac/VERSION  - OBSOLETED
#   Automatically generated by buildroot/package/director/director.mk in ${BUILD_DIR}
#   contain VERSION number used by other ZD files

# controller/ac/etc/gen_apimg_info.sh - OBSOLETED
#   this to determine the actual naming scheme on the build server
#   just fix the build server to match our current version number
#   information is now in controller/ac/etc/gen_apimg_info.cfg
#   and should be generated automatically

# controller/ac/configure.mk - FIXED to use RKS_BUILD_VERSION from buildroot/Makefile
#   Historically, this uses controller/ac/VERSION to generate VERSION_NUM
